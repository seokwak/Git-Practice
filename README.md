### What I Find Interesting

The article discusses how AI, while capable of generating code, cannot replace software developers because the real challenge lies 
in defining clear requirements, which requires human judgment and insight.

This article presents a refreshing perspective on the rise of AI in software development and addresses the common concern
that AI might soon replace human developers. The author makes the argument that while AI can be skilled at generating code, 
the real challenge in software development isn't writing the code itself but rather defining the requirements. This distinction is 
necessary because human judgment is often needed to interpret vague requirements, which is something AI struggles with.
